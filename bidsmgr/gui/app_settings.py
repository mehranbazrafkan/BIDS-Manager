r"""Typed wrapper over ``QSettings`` for cross-platform persistence.

``QSettings`` stores values per-platform in the right native location:

* macOS  → ``~/Library/Preferences/com.bidsmgr.bidsmgr.plist``
* Linux  → ``~/.config/bidsmgr/bidsmgr.conf``
* Windows → ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\bidsmgr\bidsmgr`` (registry)

This module wraps it with type-safe getters / setters and one schema
the rest of the GUI can rely on. Keep the keys in :data:`KEYS` —
adding a new one outside that namespace is a code smell.
