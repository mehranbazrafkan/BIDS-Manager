## What is BIDS Manager?

BIDS Manager is a desktop app that helps researchers turn raw MRI, EEG, and MEG
recordings into BIDS-compliant datasets. It scans your raw data, lets you review
and fix every conversion decision in a spreadsheet, runs the conversion, and then
opens the result for metadata editing, volume inspection, and validation. All in
one place, without writing scripts or editing JSON files by hand.

## Get started

The fastest way to set things up is the one-click bootstrap installer for
macOS, Linux, and Windows. It bundles a portable Python with every dependency
and registers a native desktop launcher; no prior Python install required.
See the [install guide][install] for a step-by-step walkthrough.

Once installed, launch the GUI with `bidsmgr`. Prefer the command line? Five
verbs cover the whole pipeline: `bidsmgr-scan`, `bidsmgr-rebuild`,
`bidsmgr-convert`, `bidsmgr-metadata`, and `bidsmgr-validate`. The
[documentation][docs] covers the full GUI walkthrough and CLI reference.

## The workflow

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/workflow.svg" alt="Raw data, then Scan, Review and edit inventory, Convert, Fix metadata, Inspect volumes, Validate, then BIDS dataset" width="55%">
</p>

Each feature below maps to one of the stages above.

## Features

### 1. See what you have

Point the app at a folder of DICOM, EEG, or MEG recordings, or all three at once.
It walks the tree, classifies every series, and shows the proposed BIDS names in
a spreadsheet you can sort, filter, and bulk-edit.

</p>

### 2. Convert with confidence

Override any cell before you commit. Subject names, sessions, tasks, runs:
everything updates the BIDS filename live. Hit Run and BIDS Manager handles
`dcm2niix`, `mne-bids`, and the physio backends behind the scenes, with atomic
staging so a failure never leaves your output tree half-converted.

### 3. Fix metadata visually

JSON sidecars become forms. Required fields appear in red, recommended in amber,
and missing fields are listed for you with empty inputs ready to fill. TSVs open
in an editable table. No more hand-editing files in a text editor.

</p>

### 4. Inspect your volumes

A built-in NIfTI viewer with single-slice and tri-view modes. Drag the crosshair
across all three orientations at once. For 4D data, a time-series plot shows the
signal at the crosshair voxel, with a scope grid for neighbouring voxels.

</p>

### 5. Validate in one click

Run the official BIDS validator against your dataset. Every error is clickable.
It takes you straight to the offending file, scrolls to the broken field, and
opens it for editing. Fix it, revalidate, done.

  <img src="miscellaneous/validate.gif" alt="Validate in one click" width="100%">
</p>

### 6. Provenance built in

Every action you take is recorded in your project file. Undo a mistake from
yesterday. See why a subject was renamed. Your dataset arrives with its history
attached in `dataset_description.json`, so anyone who picks it up can trace what
happened and when.
