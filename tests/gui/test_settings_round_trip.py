"""Every setting must come back out of QSettings as what went in.

This exists because one string setting was written by the loop that saves
BOOLEANS, which stores ``"1"`` for anything truthy. ``convert_deface_engine``
went in as ``"allineate"`` and came back as ``"1"``, the converter could not
resolve that id, and the lookup raised INSIDE the subject commit, so every
conversion produced nothing at all. Defacing worked in the Editor throughout,
because that dialog chooses its own engine and never reads the setting, which
is exactly why it took a real conversion to notice.

So the test is generic: save, reload, compare the whole dataclass. A string
added to the wrong list fails here rather than in somebody's conversion.
